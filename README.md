# CSF-Assessment-and-Implementation-of-MY-HOME
This is an ongoing project I am conducting, to formally assess and harden the security posture of my home, home network, and personal endpoints, with the NIST CSF as my guide. 
The end result will be a documented risk assessment, implementation of new or reconfigured controls to mitigate the findings, and the creation of documents related to future incident response and ongoing maintenence of the newly strengthened security posture.
