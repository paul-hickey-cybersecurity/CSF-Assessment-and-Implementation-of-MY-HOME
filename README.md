# NIST CSF Assessment and Implementation for MY HOME

## Introduction
This project involves a comprehensive security assessment and enhancement of my home, home network, IoT devices, and personal endpoints. Guided by the NIST CSF 2.0, the assessment will identify vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. After the initial evaluation, necessary security controls will be implemented and/or reconfigured.  

In line with the perpetual nature of the NIST framework, I will also establish mechanisms to continuously monitor and maintain the security posture: An **Incident Response Playbook** and a **Maintenance Schedule** to ensure preparedness for future incidents and provide structure for regular security reviews.  

The goal is to formally assess and harden my homeâ€™s security, establish long-term monitoring infrastructure, and implement a structured, proactive approach to incident management.
