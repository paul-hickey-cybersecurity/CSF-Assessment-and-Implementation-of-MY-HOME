# NIST CSF Assessment and implementation for MY HOME

This project will entail a rigorous security assessment of my home, my home network, and my personal endpoints, using the NIST CSF 2.0 as my guideline. After the initial assessment is complete, the necessary controls will be implemented as well. As per the framework’s active and ongoing nature, my home’s security posture will also be monitored and maintained thereafter. In addition to the assessment and implementation or reconfiguration of controls, the following playbooks and maintenance documents will be created: Incident Response Playbook, Maintenance Schedule (guided by NIST SP 800-34). Overall, the entire process will assess and harden my home’s overall security posture for the first time formally, provide ongoing infrastructure to monitor and maintain it, and provide planned and structured response to any upcoming incidents.
